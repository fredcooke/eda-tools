The BOM processing system
=========================

The BOM processing system takes a bill of material generated by KiCad
and converts it in various steps into a "shopping list" that can be
used to order from various providers.

The base of the project currently lives in
http://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/eda/boom/

The files in this directory and its subdirectories build upon the
BOOM base and add mainly parts databases.
