=========

This is a collection of utilities for Electronic Design Automation:

- boom: a BOM-processing system. Note that the core scripts of BOOM are
  at http://svn.openmoko.org/trunk/eda/boom. The material here builds
  upon them.

- dsv: data sheet viewer. A simple but efficient system for caching data
  sheets and displaying them with xpdf from command line.

- fpd2pdf: convert a set of footprints (made with FPED) into a
  reviewer-friendly PDF.

- fab: set of tools to convert/generate files for fabrication

- mlztx: set of tools to copy text across layers or across text fields
  in a layout, e.g., to place a version number at several locations

- schhist: a system to walk a KiCad project's git revision history and
  generating Web-browseable graphical differences of the schematics.

Each utility can have its own licensing terms. They're specified in the
respective directory or in the file itself.
